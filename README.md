# Verilog FFT

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of an 8-bit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

## Features

- 12-bit radix-4 Booth multiplier
- Complex multiplier that takes four 12-bit numbers as input and outputs two 24-bit numbers
- Twiddle factor amplified by 128 times

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and open it in Vivado. Follow the instructions in the documentation to get started.
